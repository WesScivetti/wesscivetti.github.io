## Biography

I am a PhD Candidate in Computational Linguistics at Georgetown University. My work focuses on using linguistic theory as a tool for interpreting language models, and on using language models as linguistic hypothesis testers and generators.

Previously, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the University of North Texas in Linguistics, where I worked with Alexis Palmer and Taraka Rama studying computational semantics and historical linguistics.

## Research Interests

My research interests include:

- Construction Grammar
- Filtered Corpus Training
- Statistical Theories of Language Acquisition
- Mechanistic Interpretability
- Computational Psycholinguistics
