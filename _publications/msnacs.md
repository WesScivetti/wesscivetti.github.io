We present the first set of multilingual fine-tuning and evaluations for the SNACS framework. We reveal, via a comparative analysis on parallel data, that the relative frequencies for different supersenses are highly dependent on language. Using data from 5 languages and a robust hyperparameter sweep, we substantially outperform the state-of-the-art on SNACS classification, finding that optimal performance is achieved by joint fine-tuning on all languages at once.
