We present a set of probing experiments targeting both the syntactic and semantic properties of the Noun-Preposition-Noun (NPN) construction. Using a set of manually annotated data extracted from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA), we find that probes trained over BERT representations are sensitive to both the form and function of the construction.
