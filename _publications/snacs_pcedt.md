We present a conversion scheme between two multilingual semantic annotation frameworks, the Semantic Network of Adposition and Case Supersenses (SNACS) and the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank. ocusing on prepositional semantics, we find considerable one-to-one overlaps between labels of the schemas, but find that the many supersenses in the configuration branch of the SNACS framework does not correspond well to any set of tags in PCEDT.
